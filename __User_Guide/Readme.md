## How to start:

### Registration, Login, Passwords, Nicknames:
**To get access to most features on the server with Lugormod-X installed, the player must log in to his account first.**

- To create a new account, use `~` button to open the console window and then type the command **`register |username| |password|`**.

If the authentication process is successful keep your username and password from now because you will need them to log in to the account.
If the server uses a security code system by default, your 4-digit security code will be generated. Keep it save too because you can recover it only through contact with server's administration.
- The command **`seccode`** allows to check your security code, **`seccode new`** will generate a new one, **`seccode toggle`** will enable or disable it. If it is enabled, the code is necessary when you are going to log in using a new IP address.

- To log in to the account use the command **`login |username| |password|`** or **`login |username| |password| |seccode|`**, if the security code is enabled and you are trying to log in from a new IP address.

- To change the account's password use **`chpasswd |new_password|`** command.

You can **not** change your **username** but instead, it is possible to change your in-game name called nickname, netname, alias.
- To change the nickname use **`alias |new_name|`** command.
