	keys:
		zone: the lmd_stashzone to connect this stash to.  Zones control how many stashes can be spawned at once.  Also, this is the area to not let the stash be removed from, if specified.
		zoneexittime: If enabled by spawnflag, how many seconds to wait before deleting the stash after it leaves the zone.  Defaults to 4
		zoneexitmessage: If a player has a stash and exits the zone, this message will be displayed along with a countdown timer.  Defaults to "You have left the stash zone."

		profession: profession bitmask of who can use this.

		minlevel: min level needed to pick this up.
		maxlevel: any players above this level cannot pick this up.

		playerflags: only players with a flag(s) specified here can pick this up.

		minstashes: players cannot pick this stash up until they have picked up this many stashes (from other spawns).
		maxstashes: players cannot pick this stash up if they have picked up more than this amount of stashes.

		name: the name to use for this stash, defaults to "money stash"

		count: number of stashes that this spawn can have spawned at once.  Defaults to 1.  If this is set to 0, the stash can be picked up by unregistered players, and will not count as a stash deposit (will not count for the minstashes/maxstashes counter).

		basedeposittime: time in msecs needed to deposit.  lmd_stashdepo can modify this.
		basedepositrandom: random amount to add to the base deposit time on pickup.  Amount added is random between 0 and this number.

		credits: base cr amount
		creditsrandom: random amount to add for core credits value.

		sound: sound to make on pickup.  Defaults to interface/secret_area.wav.  If you want more sounds, such as drop/deposit sounds, use the targets or make a feature request.

		creditshift: credit amount to shift per second.  Can be positive (increase worth longer its picked up), or negitive (decrease worth longer its picked up).  If the stash amount reaches 0, the stash is reset.
		creditshiftrandom: random amount to add to offset each credit shift by.
		creditshifttime: how many seconds to run the shift for.
		creditshiftdelay: how long to wait before starting the shift.

		spawntime: time between spawns.  Set to 0 to only spawn on use.  Defaults to the contents of the cvar lmd_stashrate
		spawnrandom: random ammount between 0 and this to offset the spawn time by.

		stashtime: after this many seconds after being picked up, make the stash dissapear.
		stashtimerandom: A number between 0 and this will be added to the stash time.

		spawnmessage: message to send on spawn
		pickupmessage: message to send to players in the zone when picked up (can be sent to all players by spawnflag)

		color: color glow to emit when not picked up.  Recommend making all stashes in a zone use the same color.
		light: light intensity to emit when not picked up
		pickupcolor: color glow to emit when picked up.  Recommend making all stashes in a zone use the same color.
		pickuplight: light intensity to emit when picked up.

		model: model to use.  Defaults to items/datapad.md3, Recommend making all stashes in a zone use the same model.
		mins/maxs
